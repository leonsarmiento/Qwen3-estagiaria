Abstract 
The size, scale, and number of subwat ersheds can affect a watershed modeling 
process and subsequent results. The object ive of this study was to determine the 
appropriate level of subwater shed division for simulating sediment yield. The Soil and 
Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model with a geographic information system interface 
(AVSWAT) was applied to four Iowa watershe ds that varied greatly in drainage area. 
Annual output was analyzed from each simulation, which was executed for 30 years using climatic data representing the 1970 to 2000 period. The optimal threshold 
subwatershed size of the total drainage area to adequately predict sediment yield was 
found to be around 3 percent. Decreasing the size of subwatersheds beyond this level 
does not significantly affect the computed se diment yield. This th reshold subwatershed 
size can be used to optimize SWAT input da ta preparation requirements and simplify the 
interpretation of results without  compromising simulation accuracy.

IMPACT OF WATERSHED SUBD IVISION LEVEL ON FLOWS, 
SEDIMENT LOADS, AND NUTRIENT  LOSSES PREDICTED BY SWAT 
Introduction 
It is common practice to subdivide a wate rshed into smaller areas or subwatersheds 
for modeling purposes. Each subwatershed is  assumed homogeneous with parameters 
representative of the entire subwatershed. However, the size of a subwatershed affects the 
homogeneity assumption because larger subwat ersheds are more likely to have variable 
conditions. An increase in the number of subw atersheds definitely increases the input 
data preparation effort and the subseque nt computational evaluation. Similarly, a 
decrease in the number of subwatersheds coul d affect the simulation results. Therefore, 
an appropriate subwatershed scale should be id entified that can efficiently and adequately 
simulate the behavior of a watershed. 
The impact of subwatershed scaling upon a wa tershed simulation is directly related to 
the sources of heterogeneity (Arnold et al. 1998), which include the channel network, 
subwatershed topography, soils, land use, and climate inputs. Goodrich (1992) studied 
how basin scales can affect the characterizati on of geometric properties. He showed that 
changes in drainage density affect the accura cy of runoff predictions. Mamillapalli et al. 
(1996) found that improved accuracy of flow  predictions for the 4,297 square kilometer 
(km2) Bosque River Watershed in central Texa s resulted from increasing the number of 
subwatersheds and/or the number of Hydrol ogic Response Units (HRUs). They did not 
present any method for determining the optim al subwatershed/HRU configuration for a 
watershed. Bingner et al. (1997)  found that predicted sediment yield for the 21.3 km2 
Goodwin Creek Watershed in northern Missi ssippi was sensitive to the number of 
simulated subwatersheds but that the pr edicted surface runoff was insensitive to 
subwatershed delineation. They also found that  sensitivity analyses should be conducted 
on land use, overland slope, and slope lengt h for different subdivisions to find the 
appropriate number of subwatersheds required for modeling a watershed. They 
2 / Jha, Gassman, Secchi, Gu, and Arnold  
  
emphasized that additional research is necessa ry to develop a more universal criteria and 
that such criteria could be very difficult to  determine. Similar to  Binger et al., FitzHugh 
and MacKay (2000) found that streamflow estimates were relatively insensitive to 
different combinations of  subwatershed and HRU delineations for the 59.6 km2 Pheasant 
Branch Watershed in central Wisconsin. Pred icted upland sediment losses did vary in 
response to subwatershed and HRU delinea tions, but the ultimate sediment loads 
estimated to leave the waters hed changed little, due to the watershe d being “transport 
limited.” They present further insights as to  why changes in subwatershed and HRU areas 
had limited impact on the Soil and Water Asse ssment Tool (SWAT) streamflow and 
sediment loss predictions. 
In this study, the SWAT model (Arnold et al. 1998; Srinivas an et al. 1998; Neitsch et 
al. 2001a,b) was used to evaluate the impact of subwatershed scali ng on the prediction of 
flow, sediment yield, and nutrient losses for f our watersheds in Iowa. The objective is to 
develop a guideline for a threshold le vel of subdivision that will allow ( a) accurate 
sediment yield predictions with SWAT, and ( b) reduction of input data preparation and 
subsequent computational evaluation e fforts without significantly compromising 
simulation accuracy.  
 
The SWAT Model 
SWAT is a basin-scale, con tinuous-time model. It operates on a daily time step and is 
designed to predict the impact of manageme nt on water, sediment, and agricultural 
chemical yields in ungauged basins. The model is physically based, computationally 
efficient, and capable of continuous simu lation over long time periods. Major model 
components include weather, hydrology, soil temperature, plant growth, nutrients, 
pesticides, and land management. The hydrolog ic components of the model have been 
previously validated for several watersheds  (Arnold and Allen 1996; Arnold et al. 1998, 
1999; Saleh et al. 2000). Brief descriptions of some of the key model components are 
provided here; more detailed descriptions of the model components can be found in 
Arnold et al. 1998, Neitsch et al. 2001b, and Jha 2002. In SWAT, a watershed is divided 
into HRUs—subwatersheds with unique soil/l and use characteristics. The water balance 
of each HRU in the watershed is represente d by four storage volumes: snow, soil profile 
Impact of Watershed Subdivision L evel on SWAT Predictions / 3 
(0-2 meters), shallow aquifer (typically 2-20 meters), and deep aquifer (more than 20 
meters). Flow, sediment, nutrient, and pesticide loadings from each HRU in a 
subwatershed are summed, and the resulti ng loads are routed through channels, ponds, 
and/or reservoirs to the watershed outlet. Surface runoff is estimated in SWAT via the 
Natural Resources Conservation Service Cu rve Number (CN) method (Mockus 1969), 
and sediment yield is calculated with the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation 
(MUSLE) developed by Williams and Berndt (1977).  
Sediment Routing 
The sediment routing model (Arnold, Willia ms, and Maidment 1995) consists of two 
components operating simultaneously: depositio n and degradation. The deposition in the 
channel and floodplain from the subwatershed to the watershed outlet is based on the 
sediment particle settling velocity. The settli ng velocity is determined using Stock’s Law 
(Chow, Maidment, and Mays 1988) and is calcul ated as a function of particle diameter 
squared. The depth of fall thr ough a routing reach is the prod uct of settling velocity and 
reach travel time. The delivery ratio is estimat ed for each particle si ze as a linear function 
of fall velocity, travel time, and flow de pth. Degradation in the channel is based on 
Bagnold’s stream power concept (Williams 1980). Bagnold (1977) defined stream power 
as the product of water density, flow rate, and water surface slope as follows: 
 0r Stream Powe v YSv =τ= γ  (1) 
where 0τ is shear stress, v is the velocity of water in the channel, γ is the specific weight 
of the water, Y is the depth of flow, and S is the slope of the channel. Williams (1980) 
modified Bagnold’s equation to place more weight on high values of stream power 
(stream power raised to 1.5). Available stream power is used to re-entrain loose and 
deposited material until all of the material  is removed. Excess stream power causes bed 
degradation and is adjusted by Universal Soil  Loss Equation (USLE)  soil erodibility and 
cover factors entered for the channel and floodplain (Wischmeier and Smith 1978). Once 
the amount of deposition and degradation ha s been calculated, the final amount of 
sediment in the reach is determined by

 ,d e g ch ch i depSed Sed Sed Sed=−+  (2) 
where Sed ch is the amount of suspended sediment in the reach, Sed ch,i is the amount of 
suspended sediment in the reach at the beginning of the time period, Sed dep is the amount 
of sediment deposited in  the reach segment, and Sed deg is the amount of sediment re-
entrained in the reach segment. Finally, the amount of sediment transported out of the 
reach is calculated by 
 *out

chVSed SedV=  (3) 
where Sed out is the amount of sediment transported out of the reach, Sed ch is the amount 
of suspended sediment in the reach, Vout is the volume of outflow during the time step, 
and Vch is the volume of water in the reach segm ent. The volume of water in the segment 
(Vch) is the product of length of the segment ( Lch) and cross-sectional area ( Ach) of the 
flow at a given depth ( Y). 
Nutrient Cycling and Movement 
The transformation and movement of n itrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) within an 
HRU are simulated in SWAT based on the cy cles shown in Figures 1 and 2.  SWAT 
tracks five different N pools in the soil (Figur e 1), two of which are inorganic (mineral) 
forms while the other three c onsist of organic forms.  Si x different pools of soil P, 
simulated in SWAT (Figure 2), are split evenly between inorganic and organic forms.

Inorganic and organic forms of N and P are input into the soil system via commercial 
fertilizer and/or live stock manure; organic N and P are also input from plant residue.  
Losses of both N and P from the soil syst em occur by crop uptake and in surface 
runoff in both the solution phase and on eroded sediment. Losses of N can also occur in 
percolation below the root zone, in lateral subsurface flow (includi ng tile drains), and by 
volatilization to the atmosphere. A supply-and- demand approach is used to simulate crop 
uptake of both nutrients. Movement of nitrate (NO 3-N) in surface runoff, lateral 
subsurface flow, and percolati on is computed as the product of the average soil layer 
NO 3-N concentration and the volume of water in  each flow pathway. The mass of soluble 
P predicted to be lost via surface runoff is determined as a function of the solution P 
concentration in the top 10 millimeters of  soil, the surface runoff volume, and a 
partitioning factor. Movement of organic N or organic and inorganic P on eroded 
sediment is estimated with a loading function initially de rived by McElroy et al. (1976) 
and later modified for individual runoff events by Williams and Hann (1978). Daily losses are computed with the loading function as a function of the nutrient concentration 
in the topsoil layer, the sediment yield, and an enrichment ratio.  
 
Watershed Descriptions and SWAT Input Data

Input Data 
Land use, soil, and topography data required for simulating each watershed in SWAT 
were obtained from the Better Assessment  Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint 
Sources (BASINS) package version 3 (USEPA  2001). Land use categories available from 
BASINS are relatively simplistic (Table 2), with only one category for agricultural use (defined as “Agricultural Land-Generic”) provi ded. An egregious e rror in the amount of 
land defined as Residential-Me dium Density currently exists in BASINS for watershed 1 
(HUC 1023005) as indicated in Table 2. No attempt to corr ect this error was made for 
this study because the main intent was to asse ss the sensitivity of SW AT to variations in 
subbasin and HRU delineations, rather than to estimate the water quality impacts of 
different practices in the watershed.

The soil data available in BASINS co mes from the State Soil Geographic 
(STATSGO) database (USDA 1994), which cont ains soil maps at a 1:250,000 scale. 
Each STATSGO map unit consists of from 1 to 21 component soils; the exact spatial 
location of these component soils are not  known within a given map unit. Each 
STATSGO map unit is linked to the Soil Interp retations Record attribute database that 
provides the proportionate extent  of the component soils a nd soil layer properties. The 
STATSGO soil map units and associated laye r data were used to characterize the 
simulated soils for the SWAT analyses. 
Topographic information is provided in BASI NS in the form of Digital Elevation 
Model (DEM) data. The DEM data was used to  generate variations  in subwatershed 
configurations for the four watersheds using the ARCVIEW in terface for SWAT 2000 
(AVSWAT), developed by Di Lu zio, Srinivasan, and Arnold (2001), as described in the 
simulation methodology section. (ARCVIEW is a Geographic Information System 
developed by the Environmental Systems Res earch Institute, Inc., Redlands, California.) 
Two other key sets of inputs required for simulating the four watersheds in SWAT 
were climate and management data. The daily  climate inputs consist of precipitation, 
maximum and minimum temperature, solar ra diation, wind speed, and relative humidity; 
these were generated internally within SW AT using monthly clim ate statistics provided 
for Iowa weather stations located in or n ear each watershed. Appropriate crop/plant and 
management parameters were input from sta ndard crop, tillage, and other data files 
provided with SWAT.  
Simulation Methodology 
A subwatershed is delineated for SWAT by estimating the overland slope using the 
neighborhood technique (Sriniva san and Engel 1991) for each grid. Once the threshold 
drainage area (minimum drainage area requir ed to form the origin of a stream) is 
specified, AVSWAT automatically delineates the subwatersheds. Different threshold 
drainage areas were used to  generate different number s of subwatersheds. These 
subwatersheds were then further subdivided into HRUs.  
The creation of multiple HRUs  within each subwatershed was a two-step process. 
First, the land use categories required for each  of the four watershed simulations were 
determined. Then the different soil types th at were associated with each land use were 
Impact of Watershed Subdivision L evel on SWAT Predictions / 9 
selected. One HRU was created for each unique  combination of land use and soil. User-
specified land cover and soil area thresholds can be applied that limit the number of 
HRUs in each subwatershed. For example, if the threshold level for land use is specified 
to be 10 percent, then the land uses that c over less than 10 percen t of the subwatershed 
area will be eliminated. After the elimination process, the area of the remaining land uses 
is reapportioned so that 100 percent of the land area in the subwatershed is modeled. In 
this study, the threshold levels for land use a nd soil were set at 0 percent, which allowed 
all soil types and land uses within each subw atershed to be included in the simulations. 
The spatial locations of each HRU were not simulated; instead, each HRU simply represented a certain percentage  of land use and soil type w ithin a subwatershed. Terrain 
parameters (slope and slope length) were also assumed to be identical for all HRUs 
within a given subwatershed, except for the channel length parameter that was used to 
compute the time to concentration, which varies with the size of the HRU. 
Other key aspects of the SWAT simulations  performed for the four watersheds are 
listed below: 
•
 Simulation period: 1970-2000 (31 years) 
• Output time step: yearly 
• Rainfall distribution: skewed normal 
• Runoff generation: CN method 
• Potential evapotranspiration (ET) generation: Penman-Monteith method 
• Channel water routing: variable-storage method 
• Channel dimensions: not active 
 
Results and Discussion 
Predicted annual average runoff and str eamflow, sediment yield, and nutrient 
loadings are reported here for several sets of subwatershed delineations for each of the 
four watersheds. Five to seven different configura tions, ranging from 1 to 3 
subwatersheds at the coarsest level to 35 to 53 subwatersheds for the most refined 
scenarios, were simulated for watersheds 1 through 4.  The total number of HRUs 
simulated for the four watersheds remain ed nearly constant across the different 
subwatershed delineations because the land use and soil thresholds were set at 0 percent. 
10 / Jha, Gassman, Secchi, Gu, and Arnold  
  
Graphical results are shown first for wate rshed 1 and then in combined form for 
watersheds 2 through 4, to accommodate th e different response characteristics of 
watershed 1.  
Runoff and Streamflow 
Figure 4 shows the predicted average annual streamflow discharges that occurred at 
the outlet of watershed 1 in re sponse to different levels of  simulated subwatersheds. The 
streamflow increased by less th an 7 percent between the coar sest and finest watershed 
delineations, indicating that SWAT’s surface runoff and streamfl ow components were 
relatively insensitive to changes in the number  of subwatersheds. Th e area-weighted mean 
curve number was virtually constant across all seven subwatershed scenarios for watershed 
1; this resulted in little variation in the total estimated surface runoff between the 
subwatershed configurations, indicating that the trend of increasing streamflow shown in 
Figure 4 resulted because of other factors. Fu rther analysis of the watershed 1 simulation 
revealed that transmission ga ins from shallow groundwater (a lluvial channels) to the main 
stream channels of the four watersheds tend ed to increase as the subwatersheds decreased 
in size, while the corresponding transmission losses to shallow groundwater declined. This 
phenomenon resulted in the net increase in stre amflow shown in Figure  4. Further details 
regarding the watershed 1 surf ace runoff and streamflow anal ysis are given in Jha 2002. 
The average annual streamflow results predic ted for the other three watershed outlets 
also remained nearly constant as the number of simulated subwatersheds increased (Figure 
5). The average fluctuation between the highes t and lowest streamfl ows for the different 
subwatershed delineation levels  was only 4 percent among the three other watersheds. The 
slight increases in streamflow were again du e to the “transmission effect” as described 
above. These relatively stable streamflow predictions are consistent with the results reported by Bingner et al. (1 997) and FitzHugh and M ackay (2000), who found that 
streamflow was relatively unaffect ed by subwatershed size for th e watersheds they studied.   
Sediment Yields 
Figure 6 shows the trend in predicted average annual sediment yield for watershed 1 
as a function of the number of simulated s ubwatersheds. In general, the predicted 
sediment yield increased at a mu ch greater rate as compared to  the streamflow results, in

response to increasing numbers of subwatersheds. A sharp increase in sediment yield 
occurred when the number of subwatersheds wa s increased from 1 to 17, but the rate of 
increase slowed significantly for delineati ons that exceeded 17 subwatersheds. These 
results indicate that there is a threshold or  critical level of s ubwatershed scaling for 
predicting sediment yields for watershed 1, and that this threshol d level occurs at a 
delineation of 17 subwatersheds. Subdivi ding watershed 1 with greater than 17 
subwatersheds does not provide a clear improvement in the se diment yield predictions, 
but using fewer than 17 subwatersheds c ould result in less stable results.

The overland slope and slope length delineate d for a subwatershed can change as the 
size of the subwatershed changes. Slope and le ngth of slope (LS-factor) parameters used 
in the calculation of the MUSLE topographic fa ctor are sensitive fact ors that can greatly 
affect the SWAT sediment yield predictions. However, further analysis of watershed 1 
revealed that relatively small variations of slope and slope length, averaged by area 
across all subwatersheds, occurred among diffe rent levels of subwatershed delineations 
(Figure 7). The LS-factor and the correspond ing predicted sediment yields were not 
sensitive to these small changes. 
A second set of sensitive factors that influe nce the SWAT sediment yield predictions 
contains the deposition and de gradation components incorporat ed in the routing process. 
As subwatershed size increases, drainage density (total channel length divided by 
drainage area) decreases because of simplifi cations in describing the watershed. When 
drainage density is reduced, previously defi ned channels and their contributing areas are 
replaced by simplified overland flow elements  that can affect the routing phenomena and 
decrease the accuracy of predic tion. Figure 8 shows that draina ge density increased as the 
number of subwatersheds increased. The slope s of the channels followed a similar trend 
(Figure 9). This increase in slope could result from a better accounting of spatial variation 
for elevation when smaller subwatersheds are used. Changes in channel length and slope

affect the deposition (caused by settling veloc ity) and degradation (see equation [1]) of 
sediments. After a certain level of subwatershed delineation, when all possible spatial 
variations due to subdivisions are introduced, further changes in the shape and size of the 
subwatersheds produce very little or insi gnificant effects on the sediment yield.  
Figure 10 shows the predicted average annual sediment yiel d trends in response to 
increasing numbers of subwatersheds for watershe ds 2, 3, and 4. The trends in sediment 
yield predictions for these three watersheds reinforce the threshold concept, that is, a

of the total drainage areas (with a median of  3 percent) for the four watersheds. These 
areas provide the upper limit of subdivision for adequate simulation of sediment yield for 
each watershed. Watershed subdivisions beyond these threshold subwatershed areas have 
an insignificant impact on sediment yield. Using subwatershed areas larger than those 
shown in Table 2 would result in significan t variations of sedime nt yield predictions. 
Nitrate Concentrations 
The trend in predicted average annual ni trate concentrations at the watershed 1 
outlet, as a function of total subwatersheds, is  shown in Figure 11. In general, the nitrate 
concentrations increased as the number of subwatersheds increased. The SWAT 
predictions indicated that 30 percent more nitrate would be  exported from the watershed 
using the finest subdivision (53 subwatersheds) as compared to the coarsest subdivision 
(5 subwatersheds). The trend of increasing ni trate losses was a function of the previously 
described increasing surface and shallow groundwa ter flows that occurr ed in relation to 
decreasing subwatershed size. Further analys is of the watershed 1 nitrate trends is 
presented in Jha 2002.  
The predicted average annual nitrate concentration trends  for watersheds 2 through 4 
(Figure 12) generally mirrore d those found for watershed 1.  Threshold subwatershed 
levels were determined to exist for the nitrat e concentrations (Table 4), above which there 
were few appreciable nitrate concentration changes. The number of subwatersheds and 
associated areas reflect  a finer resolution than those f ound for the sediment yields, for 
three out of the four watersheds.

Organic N Concentrations 
Figure 13 shows the trend of  predicted annual average organic N concentrations 
(mg/l) at the watershed 1 outlet in response to increasing numbers of simulated 
subwatersheds. The watershed 1 organic N concentrations generally decrease as the 
subwatershed size decreases, which is the opposite of what was found for the NO 3-N 
concentrations (Figure 11) and for sediment (Figure 7). The organic N loadings from the 
HRUs are directly proportional to the predic ted sediment loadings. However, the current 
channel subrouting of organic N in SWAT is not  linked to the sediment routing. Thus, the

sediment. The watershed 1 orga nic N losses do exhibit a higher  sensitivity to changes in 
subwatershed size relative to the nitrate loss results (Figure 11); the reasons for this are not clear.  
Similar organic N concentration trends we re also predicted for the other three 
watersheds as shown in Fi gure 14.  The overall trends  indicate that threshold 
subwatershed levels also occur for the organi c N concentrations, but specific thresholds 
were not determined in this case.

Mineral P Loading 
Figure 15 shows the trend of the predicted annual average mineral P concentrations 
(mg/l) at the watershed 1 outlet as a func tion of decreasing subwatershed size. The 
overall trend reflects increasing concentration levels with greater numbers of subwatersheds, with the majority of th e increase occurring be tween the first two 
subwatershed delineations. The overall increase  in mineral P concentration from 5 to 53 
subwatersheds was about 15 percent, with the apparent subdivision th reshold occurring at 
a delineation of 9 subwatersheds (Table 5). 
The mineral P trends predicted for waters heds 2 through 4 in response to increasing 
numbers of subwatersheds are shown in Fi gure 16. These trends are similar to the 
watershed 1 trend, although there was genera lly less variation pred icted for the other 
three watersheds. Appropriate subdivision th resholds for watersheds 9 through 11 are 
similar to that found for watershed 1, as indicated in Table 5.   
Organic P Loading 
The organic P trend for watershed 1 (Fi gure 17) exhibited the same decreasing 
pattern as that found for organic N, as the num ber of subwatersheds increased. This trend 
is the opposite of the trends f ound for mineral P (Figure 15) and for sediment (Figure 7).   
The organic P loads are again directly proportional to sedime nt losses from the HRUs but 
are not connected to the sediment in the SWAT  channel routing routine, so differences

Conclusion and Recommendations 
It is standard practice to subdivide a watershed into sm aller areas or subwatersheds 
for modeling purposes. A suitable method to determine an appropriate number of 
subwatersheds would aid user s in applying models such as SWAT for a variety of 
watersheds. This study provides initial guidelines for determin ing an appropriate level of 
subdivision that will efficientl y and adequately simulate the sediment yield from a 
watershed. 
The SWAT model was applied to four diffe rent watersheds with drainage areas 
ranging between approximately 2,000 and 18,000 km2. The sensitivity of the model in 
predicting sediment yield, as a function of subwatershed delineations, was analyzed for 
the four watersheds using topography (DEM),  land use, soil, and climate data obtained 
from the same sources. The results of the analyses lead to the following conclusions: 
1. Streamflow is not significantly affected  by increasing the number of subwater-
sheds. This is because the surface runoff is  directly related to  the CN, and CN is 
not affected significantly by the size of th e subwatersheds. However, there is a 
minor increase (4 percent on average) in  streamflow due to an increase in 
transmission gains (subsurface flow) and to a decrease in transmission losses as 
subwatershed size decreases. 
22 / Jha, Gassman, Secchi, Gu, and Arnold  
  
2. Predicted sediment yields were directly  related to subwatershed size. This 
variation is due to the sensitivity of overland slope and slope length, channel 
slope, and drainage density. Changes in  these parameters cause changes in 
sediment degradation and deposition, a nd, finally, to the sediment yield. 
3. Large variations in the predicted sediment  yields resulted dur ing initial changes 
in subwatershed delineations. However, the sediment yield predictions stabi-
lized for further refinements of subdividi ng the watersheds, indicating that there 
is a threshold level of subdivision beyond which addi tional accuracy in the 
predictions will not be gained. The threshold drainage area of the subwater-sheds, at which point the predicted se diment yields stabilized, was found to 
range between 2 and 6 percent of the total drainage area, with a median value of 
3 percent. Therefore, 3 percent of the to tal area is proposed as the smallest sub-
watershed size that would be considered  the threshold area  for adequate and 
efficient simulation of sediment  yield for a given watershed. 
4.
 Nitrate loading increases as subwatersh ed size decreases. This is due to the 
increase in streamflow as well as to the increase in groundwater’s contribution 
to the streamflow. In the simulations reported here, the surface runoff nitrate 
concentrations were assumed to be 20 pe rcent of nitrate concentrations of the 
water leached to groundwater. As the size of the subwatersheds decreases, sub-surface flow and groundwater flow increase,  leading to an increase in nitrate 
concentration. 
5.
 Changes in the nitrate concentrations stab ilized at higher levels of subdivision, 
resulting in threshold draina ge areas that ranged between 1.4 and 3.1 percent of 
the total watershed areas. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the 
minimum subwatershed size be set at no smaller than 2 percent of the overall 
watershed area when simulating nitrate le vels with SWAT for watersheds simi-
lar to those studied here.  
6. Mineral P concentrations increased sli ghtly as the number of subwatersheds 
were increased, resulting in a subdivision threshold of about 10 subwatersheds. 
This translates to subwatershed areas th at are 4.4 to 7.1 percent of the overall 
Impact of Watershed Subdivision L evel on SWAT Predictions / 23 
watershed areas. Thus, it appears that a minimum subwatershed size of around 5 
percent would be adequate fo r simulating mineral P losses. 
7. Concentrations of organic N and P in streamflow decreased as the number of 
subwatersheds increased, in contrast to the opposite trends found for sediment, 
nitrate, and mineral P. These results are not totally unexpected because the 
channel routing of organic N and P curre ntly are not linked to the sediment 
routing in SWAT. Future versions of SWAT should be modified to include a 
direct linkage between the routing of se diment and organic N and P.  Further 
research also is needed to investigat e why the organic N and P results show a 
relatively high level of sensitivity as th e number of subwatersheds is increased 
for a simulated watershed.  
Watershed modeling studies should include  a sensitivity analysis with varying 
subwatershed delineations similar to those desc ribed in this study. The threshold level of 
subdivision determined from the analysis s hould then be used for the actual watershed 
study. However, time and/or resource constraints will often preclude the ability to perform such a sensitivity anal ysis. As an alternative, the results from the study reported 
here can be utilized as a guide line to delineate subwatershed s for a watershed. Restricting 
the subdivision of a watershed to the threshol d levels reported he re would reduce input 
preparation efforts and subse quent computational evaluation and at the same time would 
reduce the risk of misleading re sults that could occur from us ing a subdivision that is too 
coarse. The fact that different threshol ds have emerged for different indicators 
underscores the need for SWAT users to assess which indicators have highest priority in 
their analyses. Finally, additional research is needed to ascertain if the results obtained 
here will change when using more detailed land use and soil layers  than those available 
from the BASINS package.
