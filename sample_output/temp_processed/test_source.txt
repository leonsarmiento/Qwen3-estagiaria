Landslides are one of the geological disasters with wide distribution, high impact and serious damage around the
world. Landslide risk assessment can help us know the risk of landslides occurring, which is an effective way toprevent landslide disasters in advance. In recent decades, arti ﬁcial intelligence (AI) has developed rapidly and has
been used in a wide range of applications, especially for natural hazards. Based on the published literatures, this
paper presents a detailed review of AI applications in landslide risk assessment. Three key areas where theapplication of AI is prominent are identi ﬁed, including landslide detection, landslide susceptibility assessment,
and prediction of landslide displacement. Machine learning (ML) containing deep learning (DL) has emerged as
the primary technology which has been considered successfully due to its ability to quantify complex nonlinear
relationships of soil structures and landslide predisposing factors. Among the algorithms, convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are two models that are most widely used with satis-
factory results in landslide risk assessment. The generalization ability, sampling training strategies, and hyper-
parameters optimization of these models are crucial and should be carefully considered. The challenges andopportunities of AI applications are also fully discussed to provide suggestions for future research in landslide risk
assessment.
1. Introduction
Landslides (including the movement of rocks, soils or debris down a
slope) are one of the most prevalent geological hazards in the world,
posing signi ﬁcant threats and causing substantial losses to human soci-
ety. According to the Global Fatal Landslide Database (GFLD), Fig. 1
shows the spatial distribution of the fatal landslides which has caused
serious damage to human society ( Froude and Petley, 2018 ). Unlike
other engineering materials, soils and rocks are three-phased system with
strong spatial variability and are sensitive to the change of moisture
content and the environment conditions, and respond in a highly
non-linear manner. These characteristics of soil structures make it dif ﬁ-
cult for us to prevent landslides effectively in advance. Therefore,
research on landslide risk assessment is crucial for the advancement of
human society.
Landslide risk assessment is de ﬁned as an assessment of the likelihood
of landslides occurring and the potential hazards that could result. Thepotential hazards contain the injuries, the loss of life and damaged assets
which could occur to a system like community or society in a given
period ( Guo et al., 2020a,b ). This paper mainly discusses the monitoring,
evolution and probabilistic analyses of landslides occurring which don't
address the impact on towns, residents and socio-economics. Landslide
risk assessment is divided into two categories: soft risk assessment
approach and hard risk assessment approach ( Lei et al., 2023 ). The
former focuses on the risk of landslides in a region and the latter pays
more attention to the risk of individual landslide ( Chen and Chen, 2021 ;
Lei et al., 2023 ).
In recent decades, studies have mainly focused on establishing
knowledge-driven expert systems to assess the risk of landslides ( Althu-
waynee et al., 2012 ;Kayastha et al., 2013 ;Pourghasemi et al., 2012a,b ;
Tien Bui et al., 2012a ). The results rely heavily on the personal experi-
ence of senior engineers with strong subjectivity. Moreover, the strong
spatial variability of soils and rocks causes uncertainty and diversity of
landslides in different regions ( Li et al., 2016a ;Liu and Leung, 2018 ).

Thus, expert systems are only applicable in their designated survey area,
which are highly dependent on manual labor and subjective experience
of engineers. Semi-automated and automated operations which can
represent the complex non-linear relationships of soil structures are in
high demand.
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is an advanced technology aiming to
automate intellectual tasks that are normally performed by humans. It
has an excellent ability to characterize the inherent nonlinear relation-
ships between big data especially the geotechnical data ( Baghbani et al.,
2022 ). There are many branches of AI, including machine learning,
natural language processing, cloud computing and others ( Fig. 2 ).
Currently, AI is widely used in many areas, such as facial recognition,autonomous driving and human-machine interaction ( Fig. 2 ). The main
aim of this paper is to investigate the applications of AI in landslide risk
assessment. Research shows that the primary focus of AI applications in
landslide risk assessment is machine learning (ML) containing deep
learning (DL) ( Dikshit et al., 2021 ). It is a data-driven method combining
statistics with optimization theory.
This paper fully investigates the related studies of applications of AI in
landslide risk assessment published in recent decades including reviews
and research papers until 2024. This paper begins with the brief over-view of the AI techniques mainly used in landslide risk assessment. The
next section describes how AI techniques have been used in landslide risk
assessment. It categorizes the topics into three parts including landslide
detection, landslide susceptibility assessment and prediction of landslide
displacement. Other applications like sampling strategies, hyper-
parameters optimization and the development of graphical user inter-
face (GUI) are also brie ﬂy introduced. In the next section, the challenges
and future opportunities of AI techniques applied in landslide risk
assessment are also provided. Finally, the overall conclusions are made to
summarize the whole paper. The explainable AI combining with physical
meaning and the generalization ability of the used models are crucial for
future development.
2. Brief overview of AI techniques in landslide risk assessment
This section provides a brief overview of different AI techniques used
in landslide risk assessment including ML, DL, hybrid models (HMs),
performance testing of models and GUI. The former four are the methods
and the GUI represents the useful tool mainly applied in landslide risk
assessment.
2.1. Machine learning
ML is a data-driven method combining statistics with optimization
theory. As shown in Fig. 3 , it can be used for prediction and classi ﬁcation
(Jordan and Mitchell, 2015 ). For supervised learning, the collected data
are labeled before training, but for unsupervised learning, the data are all
unlabeled ( Jordan and Mitchell, 2015 ).

Widely used ML models include linear regression, logistic regression
(LR), support vector machine (SVM), K nearest neighbors (KNN), clus-
tering, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), naive bayes (NB), etc. The
crucial step is to determine the optimal parameter values of the model.
For the collected data, a training set is used for ﬁtting the parameters, and
a testing set is used for validating the ef ﬁciency of the outputs. The loss
function is an important index to measure the performance of the model.2.2. Deep learning
DL is an advanced ML approach that requires a larger amount of data
(LeCun et al., 2015 ). DL framework is established with neural networks,
and there are almost always more than three neuron layers ( Fig. 4 a–d).
DL mainly has three steps ( Fig. 4 e). First, all the input data are subjected
to a linear regression operation to obtain a series of results. Second, the

linear regression results are substituted into an activation function to
obtain the outputs. The aim is to map the linear regression results to the
speciﬁc interval of the activation function. Third, the outputs are used as
inputs in the next layer of neurons. The calculation process is repeated to
eliminate the invalid features, and then the ﬁnal outputs can be obtained.
Compared with ML, the framework of DL more closely resembles the
complexity of the operating mechanism of the human neurological
system.
Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network
(RNN) are the two main DL frameworks that are most commonly used.
CNN is mainly used in the ﬁelds of image recognition, object recognition
and computer vision ( Fig. 4 d). RNN, on the other hand, is mainly used in
ﬁelds such as natural language processing and time series analyses
(Fig. 4 c). In time series prediction, Long-short-term (LSTM) neural net-
work's forgetting gate and memory gate effectively overcome the
forgetting problem of RNN, which can memorize the historical infor-
mation effectively ( Fig. 4 b).
Recently, transformer model consisting of encoders and decoders has
been gradually widely used in geotechnical engineering. The architecture
of transformer is shown in Fig. 5 . The model based on the attention
mechanism provides an effective solution for long-sequence time series
prediction and natural language processing ( Vaswani et al., 2017 ).
2.3. Hybrid model
HM integrates two or more ML models ( Kadavi et al., 2018 ), fully
combining the advantages of different models. It's also called ensemblelearning including bagging, boosting and stacking, etc. For instance, the
RF model is the simplest hybrid model and is composed of several de-
cision trees which can solve the over- ﬁtting problem of a single decision
tree ( Fig. 6 ). Some strategies like majority voting and averaging are used
to obtain the optimal result ( Fig. 6 ).
